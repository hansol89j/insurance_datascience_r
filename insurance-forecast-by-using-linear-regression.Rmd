# Introduction

Health insurance is insurance that covers the whole or a part of the risk of a person incurring medical expenses, spreading the risk over a large number of persons. By estimating the overall risk of health care and health system expenses over the risk pool, an insurer can develop a routine finance structure, such as a monthly premium or payroll tax, to provide the money to pay for the health care benefits specified in the insurance agreement. The benefit is administered by a central organization such as a government agency, private business, or not-for-profit entity.

According to the Health Insurance Association of America, health insurance is defined as "coverage that provides for the payments of benefits as a result of sickness or injury. It includes insurance for losses from accident, medical expense, disability, or accidental death and dismemberment" (p. 225).

*(Source: Wikipedia)*

Goal of this data processing is to **predict accurately the insurance costs**.



# Data

This dataset has 6 variable:

1. Age: age of primary beneficiary.

2. Sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male.

3. BMI: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg/m^2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9.

4. Children: Number of children covered by health insurance/Number of dependents.

5. Smoker: Is the person a smoker or not.

6. Region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.

7. Charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance.

# Insurance Member Behaviour{.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

The purpose of this chapter is to get an insight of insurance member behaviour such as: age, sex, region, smoker.



## Age of Insurance Member

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
age_group <- insurance %>%
                group_by(age) %>%
                summarise(total = n())

Agecut <- cut(age_group$age, c(seq(15, 65, by = 5), Inf), include.lowest = TRUE)

agegroup <- aggregate(total ~ Agecut, age_group, sum)

ggplot(insurance, aes(age)) +
geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1, color = 'blue') + 
geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = 'red', alpha = .5) +
theme_linedraw() + #make a theme
theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "gainsboro", colour = "white", size = 0.5, linetype = "solid"), #theme panel settings
      plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gainsboro"), #theme panel settings
      panel.grid.major = element_line(size = 0.5, linetype = 'solid', colour = "white"), #theme panel settings
      panel.grid.minor = element_line(size = 0.25, linetype = 'solid', colour = "white"), #theme panel settings
      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0, face = 'bold',color = 'black'), #title settings
      plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "italic"), #subtitle settings
      plot.caption = element_text(size = 6, vjust = -1, face = "italic")) + #caption/credit settings
labs(x = 'Age', y = 'Frequency', title = "Member of Medical Cost Insurance", #name title and axis
     subtitle = "Medical insurance's member aggregated by age") + 
guides(fill=FALSE) + #remove color legend
scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,80), breaks = c(0,20,40,60,80)) #set axis limits and break
```

The age distribution of insurance member is relatively the same, except 18 and 19 y'o members which has higher population (above 60). I also make a group of member's age on table below.

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
agegroup
```


## Sex of Insurance Member

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
sex <- insurance %>%
        group_by(sex) %>%
        summarise(total = n()) %>%
        mutate(percentage = paste0(round(100*total/sum(total),1), "%"))

plot_ly(sex, labels = ~sex, values = ~total, type = 'pie', #plotly package
        textposition = 'inside', 
        textinfo = 'label+percent',
        insidetextfont = list(color = '#FFFFFF'),
        hoverinfo = 'text',
        text = ~paste(total, 'people'),
        marker = list(colors = colors,
        line = list(color = '#FFFFFF', width = 1)), showlegend = FALSE) %>%
        layout(title = 'Gender of Medical Insurance Member', titlefont = list(size = 18, color = 'black'),
               xaxis = list(showgrid = FALSE, zeroline = FALSE, showticklabels = FALSE),
               yaxis = list(showgrid = FALSE, zeroline = FALSE, showticklabels = FALSE))
```

The gender of insurance member is almost the same (male = 676 people & female = 662 people).


## Region of Insurance Member

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
reg <- insurance %>%
        group_by(region) %>%
        summarise(total = n()) %>%
        mutate(percentage = paste0(round(100*total/sum(total),1), "%"))

plot_ly(reg, labels = ~region, values = ~total, type = 'pie', #plotly package
        textposition = 'inside', 
        textinfo = 'label+percent',
        insidetextfont = list(color = '#FFFFFF'),
        hoverinfo = 'text',
        text = ~paste(total, 'people'),
        marker = list(colors = colors,
        line = list(color = '#FFFFFF', width = 1)), showlegend = FALSE) %>%
        layout(title = 'Region of Medical Insurance Member', titlefont = list(size = 18, color = 'black'),
               xaxis = list(showgrid = FALSE, zeroline = FALSE, showticklabels = FALSE),
               yaxis = list(showgrid = FALSE, zeroline = FALSE, showticklabels = FALSE))
```

The region where insurance members are living in is evenly distributed.


## Insurance Member who Smoke

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
insurance %>%
group_by(smoker) %>%
summarise(total = n()) %>%
mutate(percentage = paste0(round(100*total/sum(total),1), "%"),
      annot = c("Non-Smoker","Smoker")) %>%
ggplot(aes(x=annot, y=total, label = percentage, fill = annot)) + 
geom_bar(stat="identity") +
geom_text(hjust = 0.5, vjust = -1, color = "black", fontface = "italic", size = 5) + #label type 
theme_linedraw() + #make a theme
theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "gainsboro", colour = "white", size = 0.5, linetype = "solid"), #theme panel settings
      plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gainsboro"), #theme panel settings
      legend.position = "none", #legend position
      legend.title = element_blank(), #remove legend title
      legend.background = element_rect(fill = "gainsboro", colour = "gainsboro", size = 0.5, linetype = "solid"), #change legend box color
      panel.grid.major = element_line(size = 0.5, linetype = 'solid', colour = "white"), #theme panel settings
      panel.grid.minor = element_line(size = 0.25, linetype = 'solid', colour = "white"), #theme panel settings
      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0, face = 'bold',color = 'black'), #title settings
      plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "italic")) + #subtitle settings
      labs(x = '', y = '', title = "Member of Medical Insurance", #name title and axis
           subtitle = 'How many smokers registered as insurance member?') + #name subtitle
scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,1500), breaks = c(0,300,600,900,1200,1500)) #set axis limits and break
```

A lot of members are non smoker (79.5% or 1064 person) and the rest are smoker.


## Number of Dependents

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
child <- insurance %>%
            group_by(children) %>%
            summarise(total = n()) %>%
            mutate(percentage = paste0(round(100*total/sum(total),1), "%"),
                  annot = c("Zero", "1 Child", "2 Children", "3 Children", "4 Children", "5 Children"))

plot_ly(child, labels = ~annot, values = ~total, type = 'pie', #plotly package
        textposition = 'outside', 
        textinfo = 'label+percent',
        insidetextfont = list(color = '#FFFFFF'),
        hoverinfo = 'text',
        text = ~paste(total, 'member'),
        marker = list(colors = colors,
        line = list(color = '#FFFFFF', width = 1)), showlegend = FALSE) %>%
        layout(title = 'Number of Dependents From Medical Insurance Member', titlefont = list(size = 18, color = 'black'),
               xaxis = list(showgrid = FALSE, zeroline = FALSE, showticklabels = FALSE),
               yaxis = list(showgrid = FALSE, zeroline = FALSE, showticklabels = FALSE))
```

## Body Mass Index of Insurance Member

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
ggplot(insurance, aes(bmi)) +
geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = 'red', alpha = .5) +
theme_linedraw() + #make a theme
theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "gainsboro", colour = "white", size = 0.5, linetype = "solid"), #theme panel settings
      plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gainsboro"), #theme panel settings
      panel.grid.major = element_line(size = 0.5, linetype = 'solid', colour = "white"), #theme panel settings
      panel.grid.minor = element_line(size = 0.25, linetype = 'solid', colour = "white"), #theme panel settings
      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0, face = 'bold',color = 'black'), #title settings
      plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "italic"), #subtitle settings
      plot.caption = element_text(size = 6, vjust = -1, face = "italic")) + #caption/credit settings
labs(x = 'Body Mass Index', y = 'Frequency', title = "Member of Medical Cost Insurance", #name title and axis
     subtitle = "Body mass index of medical insurance's member") + 
guides(fill=FALSE) + #remove color legend
scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,120), breaks = c(0,20,40,60,80,100,120)) #set axis limits and break
```

Body mass index of members are normally distributed.


## Charges of Insurance Member

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
ggplot(insurance, aes(charges)) +
geom_histogram(binwidth = 2000, fill = 'red', alpha = .5) +
theme_linedraw() + #make a theme
theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "gainsboro", colour = "white", size = 0.5, linetype = "solid"), #theme panel settings
      plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gainsboro"), #theme panel settings
      panel.grid.major = element_line(size = 0.5, linetype = 'solid', colour = "white"), #theme panel settings
      panel.grid.minor = element_line(size = 0.25, linetype = 'solid', colour = "white"), #theme panel settings
      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0, face = 'bold',color = 'black'), #title settings
      plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "italic"), #subtitle settings
      plot.caption = element_text(size = 6, vjust = -1, face = "italic")) + #caption/credit settings
labs(x = 'Charges', y = 'Frequency', title = "Medical Cost Insurance", #name title and axis
     subtitle = "Individual medical costs billed by health insurance") + 
guides(fill=FALSE) + #remove color legend
scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,250), breaks = c(0,50,100,150,200,250)) #set axis limits and break
```

The distribution of individual medical costs billed by health insurance has a positive skew.



# What Variables Affect The Medical Cost?{.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

I made this density analysis to find the variables which affect the medical costs. From this analysis (you need to see the density chart), I gain some insights:

1. Sex is not make an impact to medical costs insurance because male and female has a same distribution/density against charges (look at Chart 4.1).

2. Region is not make a big impact to medical costs insurance because 4 regions almost have a same distribution/density against charges (look at Chart 4.2).

3. Smoker and non-smoker affect the medical costs insurance because the distribution/density have a big different (look at Chart 4.3).
 
4. Total number of children/dependents have a same density against charges, except zero number of children. So, if you're not have a child it will cause an effect to medical costs insurance (look at Chart 4.4).


According to those insights, I can conclude that **Smoke, total dependents, age, and BMI** are the variables to predict the medical costs insurance.



## Charges Density Vs Sex

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
ggplot(insurance, aes(x = charges, fill = sex)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.5)
```

## Charges Density Vs Region

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
ggplot(insurance, aes(x = charges, fill = region)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.5)
```

## Charges Density Vs Smoker

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
ggplot(insurance, aes(x = charges, fill = smoker)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.5)
```

## Charges Density Vs Children

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
ggplot(insurance, aes(x = charges, fill = as.factor(children))) + geom_density(alpha = 0.5)
```



# Grouping The Equation{.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

Since smokers, total dependents, and BMI made an effect to medical costs insurance, I'm grouping those factors into 8 category shown on sub-chapter below. Eventually, I only have age or and BMI as an input variable(s) to my prediction equation. The equation will shown in sub-chapter, so you need to check it.

**Cat - 1** : Smoker, have no dependent, BMI under 30. 

**Cat - 2** : Smoker, have no dependent, BMI over 30. 

**Cat - 3** : Smoker, have dependents, BMI under 30.

**Cat - 4** : Smoker, have dependents, BMI over 30.

**Cat - 5** : Non-smoker, have no dependent, BMI under 30. 

**Cat - 6** : Non-smoker, have no dependent, BMI over 30. 

**Cat - 7** : Non-smoker, have dependents, BMI under 30.

**Cat - 8** : Non-smoker, have dependents, BMI over 30.


## Cat - 1


**Smoker, have no dependent, BMI under 30.**


```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
ins_smoker_nochild_under30 <- insurance %>%
                                filter(smoker == "yes" & children == 0 & bmi < 30)
```

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
ggplot(ins_smoker_nochild_under30, aes(x = age, y = charges)) + geom_point()
```

Age vs Charges chart looks can be approached by using linear regression.  


```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
ggplot(ins_smoker_nochild_under30, aes(x = bmi, y = charges)) + geom_point()
```

BMI vs Charges looks have a disordered correlation.


```{r, message = TRUE, echo = FALSE} 
summary(lm(charges ~ age, data = ins_smoker_nochild_under30))
```

```{r, message = TRUE, echo = FALSE} 
summary(lm(charges ~ age + bmi, data = ins_smoker_nochild_under30))
```

From those two summary, I decided to use linear regression with 2 variables (age and BMI) because it have a better R-Squared value.

So, the equation will be like:

**-956.74 + (251.20 * AGE) + (505.18 * BMI)**



## Cat - 2


**Smoker, have no dependent, BMI over 30.**


```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
ins_smoker_nochild_over30 <- insurance %>%
            filter(smoker == "yes" & children == 0 & bmi >= 30)
```

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
ggplot(ins_smoker_nochild_over30, aes(x = age, y = charges)) + geom_point()
```

Age vs Charges chart looks can be approached by using linear regression.  


```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
ggplot(ins_smoker_nochild_over30, aes(x = bmi, y = charges)) + geom_point()
```

BMI vs Charges looks have a disordered correlation.


```{r, message = TRUE, echo = FALSE} 
summary(lm(charges ~ age, data = ins_smoker_nochild_over30))
```

```{r, message = TRUE, echo = FALSE} 
summary(lm(charges ~ age + bmi, data = ins_smoker_nochild_over30))
```

From those two summary, I decided to use linear regression with 2 variables (age and BMI) because it have a better R-Squared value.

So, the equation will be like:

**8120.10 + (292.16 * AGE) + (614.01 * BMI)**



## Cat - 3


**Smoker, have dependents, BMI under 30.**


```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
ins_smoker_child_under30 <- insurance %>%
            filter(smoker == "yes" & children > 0 & bmi < 30)
```

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
ggplot(ins_smoker_child_under30, aes(x = age, y = charges)) + geom_point()
```

Age vs Charges chart looks can be approached by using linear regression.  


```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
ggplot(ins_smoker_child_under30, aes(x = bmi, y = charges)) + geom_point()
```

BMI vs Charges looks have a disordered correlation.


```{r, message = TRUE, echo = FALSE} 
summary(lm(charges ~ age, data = ins_smoker_child_under30))
```

```{r, message = TRUE, echo = FALSE} 
summary(lm(charges ~ age + bmi, data = ins_smoker_child_under30))
```

From those two summary, I decided to use linear regression with 2 variables (age and BMI) because it have a better R-Squared value.

So, the equation will be like:

**2428.48 + (259.48 * AGE) + (359.27 * BMI)**



## Cat - 4


**Smoker, have dependents, BMI over 30.**


```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
ins_smoker_child_over30 <- insurance %>%
            filter(smoker == "yes" & children > 0 & bmi >= 30)
```

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
ggplot(ins_smoker_child_over30, aes(x = age, y = charges)) + geom_point()
```

Age vs Charges chart looks can be approached by using linear regression.  


```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
ggplot(ins_smoker_child_over30, aes(x = bmi, y = charges)) + geom_point()
```

BMI vs Charges looks have a disordered correlation.


```{r, message = TRUE, echo = FALSE} 
summary(lm(charges ~ age, data = ins_smoker_child_over30))
```

```{r, message = TRUE, echo = FALSE} 
summary(lm(charges ~ age + bmi, data = ins_smoker_child_over30))
```

From those two summary, I decided to use linear regression with 2 variables (age and BMI) because it have a better R-Squared value.

So, the equation will be like:

**16021.03 + (253.72 * AGE) + (447.91 * BMI)**



## Cat - 5


** Non-smoker, have no dependent, BMI under 30.**


```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
ins_nonsmoker_nochild_under30 <- insurance %>%
            filter(smoker == "no" & children == 0 & bmi < 30)
```

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
ggplot(ins_nonsmoker_nochild_under30, aes(x = age, y = charges)) + geom_point()
```

Age vs Charges chart looks can be approached by using linear regression.  


```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
ggplot(ins_nonsmoker_nochild_under30, aes(x = bmi, y = charges)) + geom_point()
```

BMI vs Charges looks have a disordered correlation.


```{r, message = TRUE, echo = FALSE} 
summary(lm(charges ~ age, data = ins_nonsmoker_nochild_under30))
```

```{r, message = TRUE, echo = FALSE} 
summary(lm(charges ~ age + bmi, data = ins_nonsmoker_nochild_under30))
```

From those two summary, I decided to use linear regression with 1 variable (age) because it have a better R-Squared value.

So, the equation will be like:

**-3239.15 + (277.00 * AGE)**



## Cat - 6


** Non-smoker, have no dependent, BMI over 30.**


```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

```

From those two summary, I decided to use linear regression with 1 variable (age) because it have a better R-Squared value.

So, the equation will be like:

**-2155.79 + (254.01 * AGE)**



## Cat - 7


** Non-smoker, have dependents, BMI under 30.**


```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}

From those two summary, I decided to use linear regression with 1 variable (age) because it have a better R-Squared value.

So, the equation will be like:

**-2161.36 + (282.54 * AGE)**



# Charges Prediction

From grouping the equation, I made a function to predict the charges. The function is look like:

```{r, message = TRUE, echo = TRUE} 
predict <- function(x){
               for(i in 1:nrow(x)){
               if(x[i,"smoker"] == "yes" && x[i,"children"] == 0 && x[i,"bmi"] < 30){
               x[i,"result"] = -956.74 + (251.20*x[i,"age"]) + (505.18*x[i,"bmi"])
               } else if(x[i,"smoker"] == "yes" && x[i,"children"] == 0 && x[i,"bmi"] >= 30) {

And the results of my prediction is shown on table below

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE} 
predcharges <- predict(insurance)

datatable(predcharges, colnames = c('Age', 'Sex', 'BMI', 'Children', 'Smoker', 'Region', 'Charges', 'Charges Prediction'))
```




**The Root Mean Square Error of my prediction:**

```{r, message = TRUE, echo = FALSE} 
rmse(predcharges$charges, predcharges$result)
```

Mean error value of my prediction is about plus minus **4437.56**





**The Mean Absolute Percent Error of my prediction:**

```{r, message = TRUE, echo = FALSE} 
mape(predcharges$charges, predcharges$result)
```

Mean percentage error of my prediction is **26.7%**



# Study Cases

How much the insurance costs for this people?

1. Daniel, 27 years old, 34.21 BMI, have no dependent, non - smoker, and living in northeast.

2. Rani, 31 years old, 27.54 BMI, 3 dependents, smoker, and living in southeast.


Now, you can answer those question with this function:

```{r, message = TRUE, echo = TRUE} 
predict_charge <- function(age, bmi, children, smoker){
    if(smoker == "yes" && children == 0 && bmi < 30){
        result = -956.74 + (251.20*age) + (505.18*bmi)
    } else if(smoker == "yes" && children == 0 && bmi >= 30) {
        result = 8120.10 + (292.16*age) + (614.01*bmi)
    } else if(smoker == "yes" && children > 0 && bmi < 30){
        result = 2428.48 + (259.48*age) + (359.27*bmi)
    } else if(smoker == "yes" && children > 0 && bmi >= 30){
        result = 16021.03 + (253.72*age) + (447.91*bmi)
    } else if(smoker == "no" && children == 0 && bmi < 30){
        result = -3239.15 + (277.00*age)
    } else if(smoker == "no" && children == 0 && bmi >= 30){
        result = -2155.79 + (254.01*age)
    } else if(smoker == "no" && children > 0 && bmi < 30){
        result = -884.08 + (247.85*age)
    } else {
        result = -2161.36 + (282.54*age)
    }
    return(result)
    }
```


**The medical cost insurance for Daniel:**

```{r, message = TRUE, echo = TRUE} 
predict_charge(27, 34.21, 0, "no")
```



**The medical cost insurance for Rani:**

```{r, message = TRUE, echo = TRUE} 
predict_charge(31, 27.54, 3, "yes")
```
